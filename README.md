# QuantumProofWallet

## Project Description

**QuantumProofWallet** is a decentralized, blockchain-based wallet that enables users to securely store, deposit, and withdraw Ether. The wallet leverages smart contracts to ensure transparency, security, and control over user balances. The primary aim of the wallet is to create a user-friendly, robust solution for managing Ether balances on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Vision

The vision of **QuantumProofWallet** is to provide a seamless and secure solution for users to manage their Ether balances directly on the Ethereum blockchain. By utilizing smart contracts, it ensures that all transactions are traceable, auditable, and immutable, offering a high level of trust and security.

## Key Features

- **Secure Deposit**: Users can deposit Ether into the wallet, with the balance being stored securely on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Users can withdraw Ether from the wallet, ensuring that only authorized users can access their funds.
- **Balance Check**: Users can view their balance in the wallet at any time to monitor their assets.
- **Owner Control**: The contract owner has special privileges, ensuring management and potential upgrades to the wallet.

## Future Scope

1. **Multi-Signature Support**: Add support for multi-signature functionality to enhance security for withdrawals.
2. **ERC-20 Token Support**: Integrate support for ERC-20 tokens, allowing users to store and manage token balances.
3. **Quantum Security**: Develop quantum-resistant algorithms to future-proof the wallet against quantum computing threats.
4. **Cross-chain Support**: Extend the functionality to support multiple blockchains beyond Ethereum, such as Binance Smart Chain or Polygon.
